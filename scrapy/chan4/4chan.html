There is no definitive marker of 'spacecore'. The style itself is rooted in choosing garments that fit a specific feeling, thus forcing the wearer to mine various designers for unifying threads and in doing so reject the vision offered to them as consumers. The unifying thread is retrofuturism, but could just as well be post apocalyptic cowboys as far as the ethos is concerned. What we are doing is using pre-existing products to make a non-existent statement. We are turning the product into the means of production. Like sampling records, but with moods and styles. Space\/Lunarcore is about how you use what you have access to in order achieve a look. Color is far more important than in the drapey black stuff \/fa\/ usually goes for. You need to think critically, build a narrative around your clothing and color choices. Things become appropriate and inappropriate according to how they are framed within the fit.
